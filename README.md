ðŸ§  Mini Challenge: Objects

1. Object Property Access
Access the name and age properties from the following person object and log them:
const person = { name: "John", age: 30, country: "USA" };

2.Add New Property
Add a city property to the person object and log the updated object.

3.Update Property
Change the age property in the person object and log the updated object.

4.Delete Property
Remove the country property from the person object and log the updated object.

5.Object Destructuring
Destructure the name and country properties from the following object and log them:
const person = { name: "John", age: 30, country: "USA" };

6.Object Keys and Values
Given the person object, use Object.keys() to get all the keys and Object.values() to get all the values. Log both.

7.Merging Two Objects
Merge the following two objects (person and address) and log them as a single object: 
const person = { name: "John", age: 30 };
const address = { city: "New York", country: "USA" };

8.Nested Object Access
Given the following nested user object, access the city value inside the address object and log it:
const user = { name: "John", address: { city: "New York", country: "USA" } };

9.Iterating Over an Object with for...in
Iterate over the following person object using a for...in loop and log each key and its corresponding value:
const person = { name: "John", age: 30, country: "USA" };

10.Check If a Property Exists
Given the person object, check if the city property exists. If it does, log its value; otherwise, log "City not found":
const person = { name: "John", age: 30, country: "USA" };
